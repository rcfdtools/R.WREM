# HEC-HMS 4.13: Geometric properties calculator, Tc, LT, .gage and .met sentences generator
# This script has to be run in QGIS 3+ (Tested versions: 3.44.9, 4.0.1)
# Subbasin layer and CN map has to use the same projection system
# Before run, set Settings / Options / Processing / General / Invalid features filtering / Do not filter
# Steps (QGIS does't recognize the geometric fields Akm2, Pkm.... after the first run)
#   1. Run the script with compute_tc_lt = False
#   2. Close QGIS and reopen the projec
#   3. Switch compute_tc_lt = True and run

A ratio closer to 1 indicates a circular basin with rapid runoff and high flood risk, while higher values (e.g., >1.5) suggest elongated, safer watersheds. Low Kc (close to 1): Highly compact or circular. These basins collect water from all directions simultaneously, causing sharp, high-intensity peak flows. High Kc (>1): Elongated or irregular. These basins provide slower runoff, allowing water to infiltrate and reducing peak flow. Kc=P/2√(πA)',

Ranging from 30 to 100, higher CN values (e.g., 98 for paved parking) indicate higher runoff potential, while lower values (e.g., <50 for forest) indicate higher infiltration.
